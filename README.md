# Shake-2048

<h3>Shake 2048! is a sensor-based take on the popular 2048 game.</h3>

<p>This version of the game uses the directional motion sensors found in most Android smartphones to drive block movement instead of traditional swiping. This project was a collaboration effort with <a href="https://github.com/dahyekim97">Dahye Kim and Daniel Chow.</p>
